No edge checking for the array s, only some weak patten recognization of
char ' ' and '\r\n'. When a long buffer with no end of ' ' or '\r\n', it will
constantly read the buffer.
It's easy to cause Buffer OverFlow.
Once the Buffer overwrite the RET, but no 'fd'(the first args,
overwriting 'fd' will lead to exception handled), it'll lead to serious
result.
